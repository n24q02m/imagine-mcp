## 2025-06-23 - [HIGH] Unbounded download streams leading to DoS
**Vulnerability:** Downloader allowed writing chunks to disk even if the total size exceeded the 50MB limit, by only checking the limit *after* writing the chunk. Additionally, it didn't check Content-Length headers early.
**Learning:** Checking limits *after* an operation (like writing to disk) allows for a one-chunk "overread" and doesn't prevent resource consumption if the header already signals an oversized payload.
**Prevention:** Always perform a pre-flight check on Content-Length headers if available, and validate that bytes_read + len(chunk) does not exceed the limit before processing/writing the chunk.
